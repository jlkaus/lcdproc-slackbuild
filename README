lcdproc is client/server suite for interacting with various LCD devices.

The server daemon works with different display sizes and serial
interfaces.

Various clients are included as well, to display things like CPU load,
system load, memory usage, uptime, date and time, etc.

Clients control the server using a simple TCP connection interface,
enabling writing simple clients that can remotely control a particular
LCD.
